# My emacs config

All of the configuration is documented in `emacs-config.org`. And this is read well
by github. This is also the file to change if you want to make changes yourself.

### Some packages that will have to be installed outside emacs:

- `emacs-goodies-el`

- `pylint` -- This you install via pip: `sudo pip3 install pylint`

- `g++`
